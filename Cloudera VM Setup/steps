Download oracle vm virtual box manager.
Download cloudera VMWare from cloudera site https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-13.html

To import downloaded clodera vm in oracle vm virtual box manager:

a) if you elected to use VirtualBox, you would have downloaded and extracted a *.ovf file from Cloudera. Use the “File -> Import Appliance” menu inside VirtualBox to open your downloaded *.ovf file, or simply double-click on the file itself and VirtualBox should handle it from there.
b) If you elected to use VMWare, you would have downloaded and extracted a *.vmx file and a *.vmdk file from Cloudera. 
These two files combine to help VMWare Workstation or Player open the Quickstart VM. Follow below steps to import .
 i) In Oracle virtual box manager -> machine -> new -> give some name ->use an existing virtual hard disk file -> select vmdk file -> create.

-> To open the files in same window in cloudera vm
Aplications,places, System ->  behaviour -> enable "Always open in browser windows"
